# Smart-Watch-Temperature-Sensor



<h4><b>Step 1: Acquireing Parts<b><h4>
  
  Parts needed 
  - x4 Male-male connectors
  - x1 36-pin 0.1" female header
  - x1 Short feather 12-pin male header
  - x1 TMP006 tempreature breakout sensor
  - x1 Raspberry pi zero w starter kit
  - x1 PCB
  - x1 Soldering iron 
  - x1 Sponge 
  - x1 Roll of lead-free solder

<h4><b>Step 2: Solderring and Assembly<b><h4>
  
Let's begin with the TMP006 sensor. You should solder the headers to your sensor first so you can test it start by soldering placing your  headers on to a breadboard then plance your sensor on top. solder each pin for a good connection using your soldering iron and solder 
you should have something that looks like whats below:

next you'll want to solder some sockets to the raspberry pi 

and finally soder sokects for the top of your PCB and headers for the bottom the idea is to get the headers of the sensor to connect to the socket of the PCB and it's headers to connnect to the pi
