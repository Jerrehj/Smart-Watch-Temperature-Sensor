<h1>Week 9 hardware (Nov. 5/7)</h1>
<body>
<b>Hello, the updates for week 9 are as follows: due to a lost PCB, a new one had to be made pushing back the progress of the temperature sensor. I will be taking extra effort to make up for lost time by attending additional sessions as the next weeks milestone requires the PCB to be able to power up. the replacement PCB requires no additional cost and all other parts have been completed. In terms of financial situation, there are no changes.<b>

<h1>Week 8 hardware (Oct. 29/31)</h1>
<body>
<b>Hello. we've hit week 8 of the temperature sensor build. To keep you up to speed, the board is being printed and sodered. I've also recently had to purchase a new charger for the raspberry pi zero and will update the budget to reflect that. other than whats listed above the project on on track.<b>

<h1>Week 7 hardware (Oct. 15/17)</h1>
<body>
<b>Hello. As we hit week 7 of the temperature sensor build, I’d like to keep you up to speed on what’s happening. For starters the week 7 PCB milestone has been completed to see the design please see below. In terms of financial status all parts have been purchased with the exception of a mini HDMI adapter but fortunately one has been purchased and is arriving on time. Its possible revisions may need to be done with the PCB board as things may change but for now it is completed.<b><br><br><b>Breadboard:</b><br>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jerrehj/Smart-Watch-Temperature-Sensor/master/CENG%20317%20Design%5B3850%5D_bb.png<br><b>Schematic:</b><br>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jerrehj/Smart-Watch-Temperature-Sensor/master/CENG%20317%20Design%5B3850%5D_schem.png<br><b>PCB:</b><br>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jerrehj/Smart-Watch-Temperature-Sensor/master/CENG%20317%20Design%5B3850%5D_pcb.png<br><b>.fzz file:</b><br>https://github.com/Jerrehj/Smart-Watch-Temperature-Sensor/blob/master/CENG%20317%20Design%5B3850%5D.fzz
